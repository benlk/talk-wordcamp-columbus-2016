			<h2>Plugins</h2>
			<p>The only sort of plugin solutions I'm aware of are <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mobile-edition/">thing like WP Mobile Edition</a> that load a fully separate theme for mobile browsers.</p>
			<p>Downside of this approach: They don't work for narrow desktop browsers.</p>
			<p>Let's use an example: <a href="http://hpmor.com/">hpmor.com</a>.</p>
			<img src="img/hpmor-desktop.png" alt="Here's a screenshot of hpmor.com in a desktop-width browser. It looks like a normal web page" />
			<p>What does this site look like on, say, an iPhone?</p>
			<img src="img/hpmor-iphone-5.png" alt="An screenshor of hpmor.com loaded in Safari on an iPhone 5, in portrait orientation. The careful styling of the desktop-width hpmor.com is completely replaced with styles from a boilerplate mobile theme." style="max-width: 450px;" />
			<p>Wow, that looks like an entirely different theme. Okay, how does it look in a just-as-narrow desktop browser?</p>
			<img src="img/hpmor-desktop-narrow.png" alt="" style="max-width: 450px;"/>
			<p>While this site adapts to different devices, it's not reponsive. A truly responsive site would work at the same widths on <em>any</em> device.</p>
			<p>hpmor.com uses a plugin called WP Mobile Editions, originally by CrowdFavorite. There are a lot of dead links when talking about the plugin, since CrowdFavorite appears to have ended support for the plugin after being bought. There's still a plugin under the same name, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mobile-edition/">WP Mobile Edition</a> in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory, which you're welcome to check out.</p>
			<p>Remember the risks of serverside device detection:</p>

Otherwise, half the entries in their /var/log/syslog are just 'SERVER BELOW TRYING TO START CONVERSATION *AGAIN*.' and 'WISH THEY'D STOP GIVING HIM SO MUCH COFFEE IT SPLATTERS EVERYWHERE.'" alt="Server Attention Span"/></a>
